# Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on Artificial Intelligence for Network Slicing Reference Architecture

## Overview

This project aims to develop an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) leveraging Artificial Intelligence techniques within the context of a Network Slicing Reference Architecture. The system is designed to monitor, analyze, and detect potential intrusions or anomalous activities within distinct network slices.

## Objectives

- Implement machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection within specific network slices.
- Develop a scalable and adaptable IDS framework capable of integrating with diverse network architectures.
- Provide real-time monitoring and alerts for potential security threats within each network slice.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Models:** Utilize various AI models (e.g., neural networks, decision trees) for anomaly detection.
- **Network Slice Integration:** Ensure compatibility with different network slicing architectures.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of network behavior for immediate threat detection.
- **Alerting System:** Notify administrators or relevant entities upon detection of potential intrusions.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Data Collection Module:** Gathers network traffic data within each network slice.
2. **Preprocessing Unit:** Cleans and preprocesses incoming data for analysis.
3. **AI Engine:** Utilizes machine learning models to detect anomalies.
4. **Alerting Mechanism:** Notifies stakeholders in case of detected intrusions.

### Workflow

1. **Data Collection:** Traffic data collected from each network slice.
2. **Preprocessing:** Data undergoes cleaning and transformation.
3. **Anomaly Detection:** AI Engine analyzes preprocessed data for anomalies.
4. **Alert Generation:** Alerts triggered upon detection of potential intrusions.

## Usage
